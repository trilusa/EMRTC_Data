Rider: [William Fawcett](mailto:William.Fawcett@student.nmt.edu)  
Present: Joseph, Jayden, Will  
MLO sensors made 10/30/2024  
Test speed ranges: 5, 10 and 15 mph    
5 seconds to change speed, 15 seconds at each speed, all the way up and back down. 5 seconds rest before stopping data collection.   
Goal strain when knee is at top of cycle: 15% to 20%  
Measurements:  
	Bottom of cycle: 32 cm   
	Bottom 45 forward: 32.5 cm  
	Top of cycle: 37 cm   
	Top 45 forward: 35.75  
	Rear middle: 36.5 cm   
	Top 45 rear: 37 cm   
	Front middle: 34 cm   
Bottom 45 rear: 34 cm   
Note: from top 45 rear to direct top no knee angle change visible, ankle rotates at that point.   
Note: Athletic tape wrapped around ends of sensor so duck tape is not directly contacting. 

**Test 1: MLO-Y  Covered** 11/05/24     
Positive wire partially broke when applying 2nd layer to cover sensor, should still work, may not.   
Stretch 33.5 cm  
Unstreched: 29.5 cm   
Wire ripped out or broke either during removal or testing 

**Test 2: MLO-W Covered** 11/05/25   
Sensor attached without issue   
Stretched: 31.5 cm   
Unstretched: 28.5 cm  
Re running at higher strain   
T2  
Stretched:  33.5 cm  
Unstretched: 30.5 cm  
Note: slipped back to previous strain on sensor. Could be due to new taping method or slippage of knee sleeve. 

**Test 3: MLO-B Covered**   
Note: wire is slightly pulled due to covering method, will have to look into a new method   
Stretched: 31.5  
Unstretched: 29.5  
Lots of slipping   
T2  
Note: will remove black tape from PDMS and run with just duck tape.
